# Neo4j Cluster ops on azure with ansible
This is just me practicing/having a bit of fun. For now keeping a very flat structure with a few playbooks and no fancy roles etc.

## Setup
Install ansible (run in python venv for instance)

### Inventory (dev/)
Currently using KEY_DATA to store my public ssh key in dev/group_vars/all.yml (update accordingly)
